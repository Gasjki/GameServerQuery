# ðŸ“Š Game Server Query

Current version: **1.0.13**

### [Inspiration: GameQ by AustinB](https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ)

This script is an updated version of [GameQ](https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ) script created by AustinB. I recommend accessing his repository
and give him a beer. He deserves it!<br /><br />
I decided to create this repository for my next project. Compared to the original script,
this one is more configurable.

### Good to know

At this moment, only Source games are supported by this library. I'm working on supporting all games that are
currently supported by GameQ.
