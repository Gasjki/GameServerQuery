# ðŸ“Š Game Server Query

Current version: **1.0.1**

### [Inspiration: GameQ by AustinB](https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ)

This script is an updated version of [GameQ](https://github.com/Austinb/GameQ) script created by AustinB. I recommend accessing his repository
and give him a beer. He deserves it!<br /><br />
I decided to create this repository for my next project. Compared to the original script,
this one is more configurable.

### Good to know

At this moment, only Source games are supported by this library. I'm working on supporting all games that are
currently supported by GameQ.

### Requirements
- PHP 8.0+
- [BZip2](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.bzip2.php) - Used by the Source Protocol

### Installation

Use the following Composer command to add your package:

> composer require gasjki/game-server-query

**Note:** Update your package to the latest version using `composer update gasjki/game-server-query`.

### Examples
